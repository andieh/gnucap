Readme for gnucap-uf 0.0.2

this forks from gnucap and includes several experiments and workarounds.
there exist plans to seperate out improvements and fold back to upstream.

=== build system ===

see INSTALL. for better coexistance with other gnucap releases, you may want to
configure --with-program-suffix=-uf.

=== regression test suite ===

gnucap-uf implements an automated test suite (automake based, with noise
filter). the directory 'tests' contains a set of tests that should pass before
installation. type "make check". some tests are known to fail (XFAIL_TESTS),
these are meant to document problems. feel free to contribute patches.

=== module compilation ===

compile a plugin from source code
$ gnucap.mk file.so

compiles cc to so prior to dlopen.
gnucap> load file.cc

=== Two time analysis (aging etc.) ===

.ttr [ Tstart ] Tstop [ tstop tstep ] [<args>]
args are
* <multiplier>, increase timestep multiplicatively.
cont: continue with aged node values
cont_dc: continue from dc operating point
new: start with fresh devices

EXAMPLES
see regression tests.

=== dc analysis ===

- takes uic argument. compute solution close to specified initial conditions.
- improve dc sweep initial values and fallback in case of non-convergence.

=== dynamic dc analysis ===

.ddc command. like .dc, but provides dv probe for voltage nodes.

EXAMPLES
spice
c1 0 1 ic=1
r1 0 1 1
.print dv(1)
.ddc

see regression tests

=== sensitivity analysis ===

- sensitivity probes in .ac analysis.
- .sens command

EXAMPLES
see regresion tests

=== remote control ===

the .sock command starts an interactive command for direct communication with
the simulator kernel. this is for academic purposes only.
