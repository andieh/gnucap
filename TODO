in general, XFAIL_TESTS document bugs and todos. see tests/Makefile.am.

the main TODO is folding back into (modules for) upstream gnucap.

- the tr-like dc sweep makes use of a vdcstack

currently, upstream gnucap uses keep_voltages and restore_voltages to memorize
operating points. gnucap-uf adds optional push/pop arguments to these
functions. with this, nested dc sweeps can stash old operating points. these
are required for step controlled dc sweeps.

- sensitivity requires more card interface functions, and transposed solver.

gnucap-uf implements a sensitivity analysis. for this, some do_sens functions
are required in CARD. the interface might be suboptimal but should be added to
gnucap some way or other. m_matrix.h adds a transposed backward substitution
originally implemented for gnucap-a.

- the gnucap.mk thing, used in uf/c_attach.cc

gnucap.mk is a makefile that takes care of compilation at runtime. it is
invoked by the attach/load command where necessary. other extensions add more
rules for other purposes. e.g. gnucap-adms injects a .va->.cc rule.

- the geda plugins make use of the pluggable subcircuit model thing

the .subckt and module commands (in lang_spice and lang_verilog) hardwire the
subcircuit model implementation. injecting different subcircuit backends can be
useful for model order reduction or other subcircuit manipulation. currently,
gnucap-geda implements a custom subcircuit that collapses nodes that are
connected by nets.

other TODOs are

- global nodes (other than gnd)
- finally remove obsolete callbacks
- default plugins
- output plugins
- discrete time
- relative time
- plggable nodes (dispatcher)
- fix logic
